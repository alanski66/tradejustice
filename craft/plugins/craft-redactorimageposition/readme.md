# Craft Redactor Image Position
Adds the ability to apply image positions via the Redactor edit modal.

## Installation
1. Download & unzip the file and place the `redactorimageposition` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git@github.com:picdorsey/craft-redactorimageposition.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
4. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
5. The plugin folder should be named `redactorimageposition` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

On installation, the `imagePosition` plugin should automatically be added to your Redactor configuration files located at `craft/config/redactor`. **Some environments lack the correct privledges to write to these files and the `imagePosition` plugin must be added manually.**
