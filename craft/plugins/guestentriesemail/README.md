# Guest Entries Email Notification
### A Craft CMS Plugin

This plugin extends Pixel &amp; Tonic&rsquo;s [Guest Entries](https://github.com/pixelandtonic/GuestEntries/) plugin with email notifications.

## About

From the [original release notes](https://github.com/wbrowar/Craft-Guest-Entries-Email-Notification/blob/master/README.md):

> Here&rsquo;s the scenario. I&rsquo;m a big fan of saving a copy of form submissions into the database as a backup for clients. While the [Contact Form](https://github.com/pixelandtonic/ContactForm/) plugin is great for a very basic contact form, I often find myself needing other form fields that have their own validation needs. The [Guest Entries](https://github.com/pixelandtonic/GuestEntries/) plugin works great for creating the backup entries, but it just lacks the notification to the client that a new submission has been added.

The plugin takes the field values submitted through a Guest Entries-based form and emails it to a list of people of your choosing.

## About this fork

Both the email subject and the body can be composed as **Twig templates**. The default template renders the raw field data as a table, handling arrays on the first level but nothing else.

The plugin supports differentiating between entry types as well, not just between sections.
